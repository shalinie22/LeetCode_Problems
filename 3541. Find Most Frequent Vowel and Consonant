Example 1:

Input: s = "successes"

Output: 6

Explanation:

The vowels are: 'u' (frequency 1), 'e' (frequency 2). The maximum frequency is 2.
The consonants are: 's' (frequency 4), 'c' (frequency 2). The maximum frequency is 4.
The output is 2 + 4 = 6.




class Solution:
    def maxFreqSum(self, s: str) -> int:
        Max_count_vowels=0
        Max_count_consonent=0
        unique_letters = "".join(set(s))
        for i in unique_letters:
            count_of_letter = s.count(i)
            if i in "aeiou":
                if Max_count_vowels<count_of_letter:
                    Max_count_vowels=count_of_letter
            else:
                if Max_count_consonent<count_of_letter:
                    Max_count_consonent=count_of_letter
        
        return Max_count_vowels+Max_count_consonent





######Alternate Solution
s = "successes"
Max_count_vowels=0
Max_count_consonent=0

for i in set(s):
    if i in "aeiou":
        Max_count_vowels = max(Max_count_vowels, s.count(i))
    else:
        Max_count_consonent = max(Max_count_consonent, s.count(i))
print(Max_count_vowels+Max_count_consonent)
